Prompts

	-Asked for help generating the initial HTML/CSS templates for the project’s static pages (landing, about, help, and settings). The AI produced the basic layout, including the navigation bar and page structure, but I manually adjusted the spacing, alignment, colors, and overall styling.

	-Asked the AI to help design the Settings page layout, including suggestions for input field styling, dropdown structure, section headings, and how to structure a Saved Information panel. We later rewrote portions of the layout myself, added padding, improved the spacing, and unified the UI with the rest of the pages.

Issues

	-Inconsistent spacing and alignment between pages. The AI templates had different default margins and paddings, and various pages (help vs. landing vs. settings) did not visually match.

	-CSS not applying or partially applying, caused by incorrect file paths, caching, and conflicting styles. We had to manually debug the loading order and override rules.

Fix

	-We adjusted the HTML/CSS templates generated by the AI and manually unified spacing, line-height, padding, and alignment across all static pages.

	-We rewrote large portions of the Settings page layout, including centering the entire card, adding consistent padding, and placing the Save button inside a separate action-row to control spacing.

Explanation

	-These fixes were necessary to make the static pages visually consistent and functional. The AI-generated templates provided a starting point, but the final UI (spacing, colors, typography, alignment, and page layout) required significant manual adjustments to meet the expected look and to ensure uniformity across all pages.




2. Creating the navbar
	Prompts: I want to create a navbar. Create a left side navbar with a website name, buttons below, and a signout button at the bottom.
	Issues: Color was wrong, icons used were simply apple emojis that don't match, and I lots of redundant code.
	Fix: I manually changed colors, used google icons to replace emojis, and asked AI to make a navbar file and how to
		use that else where.
	Explanation: Color and icons is important to make the website like modern and sleek. Most importantly however,
		previously I would copy paste a long html for each page as navbar. But by creating a navbar file and using
		a script to import navbar in each page, we can make code a lot cleaner and more organized. Also, modifying navbar
		doesn't require modifing every file.

3. Improving the navbar
	Prompts: I wanted navbar to highlight what page the user is currently on. I asked AI to darken buttons based off
		of the page the user is currently on.
	Issues: No buttons were highlighted no matter what I clicked.
	Fix: I found out that AI was checking for the wrong url names, and I simply had to change them to the correct file names
	Expalantion: This is a super important UI component as users need to be able to see what page they are super easily.
		Furthermore, by not checking the correct file name, we are unable to ever make the code work unless we fix it.
