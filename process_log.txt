Prompts

	-Asked for help generating the initial HTML/CSS templates for the project’s static pages (landing, about, help, and settings). The AI produced the basic layout, including the navigation bar and page structure, but I manually adjusted the spacing, alignment, colors, and overall styling.

	-Asked the AI to help design the Settings page layout, including suggestions for input field styling, dropdown structure, section headings, and how to structure a Saved Information panel. We later rewrote portions of the layout myself, added padding, improved the spacing, and unified the UI with the rest of the pages.

Issues

	-Inconsistent spacing and alignment between pages. The AI templates had different default margins and paddings, and various pages (help vs. landing vs. settings) did not visually match.

	-CSS not applying or partially applying, caused by incorrect file paths, caching, and conflicting styles. We had to manually debug the loading order and override rules.

Fix

	-We adjusted the HTML/CSS templates generated by the AI and manually unified spacing, line-height, padding, and alignment across all static pages.

	-We rewrote large portions of the Settings page layout, including centering the entire card, adding consistent padding, and placing the Save button inside a separate action-row to control spacing.

Explanation

	-These fixes were necessary to make the static pages visually consistent and functional. The AI-generated templates provided a starting point, but the final UI (spacing, colors, typography, alignment, and page layout) required significant manual adjustments to meet the expected look and to ensure uniformity across all pages.
